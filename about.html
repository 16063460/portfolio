<div class="abouttext">
    One day I hope to become
    an employable concept artist for major media industries including
    cartoon shows or video games.
<br>
</br>
    Despite being skilled at drawing my whole life, I am somewhat
    new to digital art and three dimensional animations. I have always
    had a strong interest in making two dimensional animations.
    I wish to have finally fully pursued my interest after I finish
    my degree here at Massey!
<br>
</br>
    The source of my inspiration comes from the music that I listen
    to, artists that I look up to and themes that I find fascinating.
    My work is often emotionally expressive in some way. I use my drawings
    as a method of communication to the viewers the same way a writer
    would write a message for the readers. For me, my art is my most
    identifiable signifier of my personality.
